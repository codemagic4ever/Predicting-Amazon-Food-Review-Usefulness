# Predicting-Amazon-Food-Review-Usefulness
This project, completed for the machine learning course, explores the Grocery & Gourmet Foods domain. It analyzes Amazon food reviews aiming to derive valuable insights. The project's objectives include identifying trends, performing data-driven analyses, and applying machine learning models to predict relevant outcomes. Using Python and data science tools, we processed and analyzed the dataset to extract meaningful insights.
  The project is organized as follows:
    **Data Loading and Preprocessing** - Initial data exploration, cleaning, and transformation.
    **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** - Visualization of key trends and identification of potential insights.
    **Modeling** - Application of machine learning models to predict various outcomes.
    **Results and Analysis** - Evaluation of model performance and analysis of key findings.

This project demonstrates the application of machine learning techniques to real-world grocery data offering insights useful to the relevant audience. If Team 3 were to work on this project in the future, we would work on improving the model accuracies.
